# netstreams
Simple terminal net stream player

# usage

    netstreams [ARGS]

    Options:
      -q: Query
      -s: Source

# Install

# Bugs
- Currently very slow on huge stream lists

# Configuration
Currently, netstreams relies on Mplayer in order to work.
<br>By defect, it looks on the bin folder for an executable file and falls back on the 'mplayer' command.
<br>It is untested in other OS other than Windows so input about other systems would be apreciated.
