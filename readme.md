# netstreams
Simple terminal net stream player

# usage
netstreams [ARGS]

Options:
  -q: Query
  -s: Source

# Install

# Bugs
- Currently very slow on huge stream lists

# Configuration
Currently, netstreams relies on Mplayer in order to work.
By defect, it looks on the bin folder for an executable file and falls back on the 'mplayer' command.
It is untested in other OS other than Windows so input about other systems would be apreciated.
